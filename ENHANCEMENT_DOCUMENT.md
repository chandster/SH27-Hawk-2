# Hawk Page Indexer Enhancements

## Overview

This document outlines the enhancements made to the Hawk Page Indexer system, particularly focusing on the URL indexing capabilities. The changes improve how the system decides which pages to index based on user-defined rules and enhances the quality of indexed content.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Rule-Based Indexing

We've implemented a comprehensive rule-based system for determining which pages should be indexed. The system now supports:

- **Site-level rules**: Indexing based on hostname (e.g., "www.example.com")
- **Exact URL matching**: Indexing specific URLs
- **String pattern matching**: Indexing URLs containing specific strings
- **Regular expression rules**: Indexing URLs matching regex patterns

### 2. Improved Crawlers

The crawler classes have been refactored and enhanced:

- **Modular design**: Crawlers are now defined in separate modules for better maintainability
- **Better text extraction**: Improved algorithms for extracting readable content from different page types
- **Error handling**: Robust error catching to prevent crashes during crawling
- **Metadata support**: Added capability to store metadata about crawled documents

### 3. Enhanced Document Object

The `CrawledDocument` class has been enhanced to:

- **Store metadata**: Track when documents were crawled and by which crawler
- **Provide richer data**: Support for additional fields beyond just URL, title, and text
- **Better serialization**: Improved JSON conversion for storage and retrieval

## Implementation Details

### Rule Checker

The core of the enhancement is the `RuleChecker` class, which:

1. Loads user-defined rules from Chrome storage
2. Evaluates URLs against these rules to determine if they should be indexed
3. Reloads rules when they change in storage
4. Provides detailed logging of indexing decisions

```javascript
// Example of how the RuleChecker evaluates a URL
shouldIndex(url) {
    // Check against all rule types
    const siteMatch = this.checkSitesList(url);
    const urlMatch = this.checkUrlsList(url);
    const stringMatch = this.checkStringMatchesList(url);
    const regexMatch = this.checkRegexList(url);

    // Page should be indexed if any rule matches
    return siteMatch || urlMatch || stringMatch || regexMatch;
}
```

### Crawler Improvements

The crawler implementations have been updated to:

1. Intelligently extract text content from various page elements
2. Skip hidden elements to avoid indexing invisible content
3. Normalize URLs by removing fragments for consistency
4. Provide better error reporting and fallback mechanisms

```javascript
// Example of improved text extraction in GenericCrawler
const textElements = document.querySelectorAll('p, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6, li, td, th, span, div');
const texts = [];

textElements.forEach(el => {
    // Skip hidden elements
    if (el.offsetParent === null && el.style.display === 'none') {
        return;
    }
    
    const text = el.textContent.trim();
    if (text && text.length > 0) {
        texts.push(text);
    }
});
```

### Content Script Flow

The content script now follows this processing flow:

1. Load user-defined rules from Chrome storage
2. Listen for page load completion
3. Check URL against user rules to determine if indexing is needed
4. Select the appropriate crawler based on URL compatibility
5. Extract and process page content
6. Add metadata about the indexing process
7. Send the document to the background script for storage

## Usage

To leverage these enhancements, users can:

1. **Define rules in the settings page**: Access the Hawk settings page and navigate to the Indexing section
2. **Add site rules**: Add hostnames to index all pages from specific sites
3. **Create URL rules**: Specify exact URLs to index
4. **Define string patterns**: Add string patterns to match URLs containing those strings
5. **Create regex patterns**: Add regex patterns for more complex URL matching

## Benefits

These enhancements provide several key benefits:

- **More targeted indexing**: Better control over which pages are indexed
- **Reduced storage usage**: Only index pages that match user-defined rules
- **Improved content quality**: Better content extraction leads to more relevant search results
- **Debugging support**: Enhanced logging helps identify why pages are/aren't indexed
- **Future extensibility**: Modular design makes it easier to add new crawlers or rule types

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements could include:

- Crawler-specific settings for different content types
- Content filtering based on page elements or sections
- Integration with external indexing services
- Machine learning for identifying high-value content
- Real-time status indicators for indexing progress
